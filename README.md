# Weather App – iOS (SwiftUI + OpenWeatherMap API)

This is a weather forecasting application developed using SwiftUI and the OpenWeatherMap One Call API. It provides real-time weather data, hourly forecast, and seven-day predictions with a clean and animated interface.

## Overview
The goal of this application was to build a functional weather app using data modeling, API integration, and SwiftUI animations. The project follows MVVM architecture, with reusable UI components and scalable design.

## Key Features
- Real-time weather updates (temperature, wind, humidity, conditions)
- Six-hour hourly forecast and seven-day weekly forecast
- Animated weather interface with clouds, rain, and gradient transitions
- Custom API client for data handling and token management
- Temperature unit switching (Celsius and Fahrenheit)
- MVVM architecture for clean and scalable code

## Technologies Used
- Swift, SwiftUI
- URLSession, JSON Parsing
- OpenWeatherMap One Call API
- MVVM architecture
- SwiftUI transitions and gradient animations

## What I Learned
- Building API service clients in Swift
- Using MVVM to structure SwiftUI applications
- Working with animations and dynamic gradients
- Implementing reusable SwiftUI components
- Handling live data and UI updates
